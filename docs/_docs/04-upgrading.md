## Step 1. Connect DevKit to your computer via USB

Once the DevKit is connected, in Windows you will see a new USB mass storage device in Windows Explorer called `AZ3166`. 

## Step 2. Upgrade firmware

1. Download the latest firmware: 
 [devkit-firmware-1.0.0.bin](https://azureboard.blob.core.windows.net/firmware/devkit-firmware-1.0.0.bin)

2. Drag & drop the `.bin` file you downloaded to `AZ3166` device.

3. Wait until the file is copied, then the DevKit will reboot to the latest firmware.
